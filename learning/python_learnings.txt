1. map lambda function:
 	eg.
		list(map(lambda n: n * 2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
			o/p: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
		
 	Definitions:
		Lambda: A lambda expression is a way of creating a little function inline, without all the syntax of a def. 
		Map: The map() function runs a lambda function over the list 
	
	 syntax: 
		list(map(lambda arg1, arg2 ... : expression of arg1, arg2, ..., list))
		
2. Tuple: (, , , ), List: [, , , ], Dictionary: {"key": value, ....}, set:{, , , }
	Dictionaries: Keys can only be strings, numbers, or tuples, but values can be any data type.
	In sets, element is not duplicated.
	
3. # Loop through the list and iterate on both index and element value

		squares=['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']
		for i, square in enumerate(squares):
    		    print(i, square)
		    
4. Using "global" keyword global variable is created from witihin local space.

5. When the number of arguments are unknown for a function. Eg. def printAll(*args): # All the arguments are 'packed' into args which can be treated like a tuple
								def printDictionary(**args): # The arguments can also be packed into a dictionary

6. try:
       .......	
   except error_name: # to catch error_name error name type exceptions in code following try
       ......
   except:   # catch all remaining exception. this is broad exception.
   else:  # to notify user that code following try is executed succesfully
   finally: # to all reosurce closing or clearing can be done as it is executed at the end
   
7. Classes in python
	In python class, varables and methods are of 2 types: class and instance
	Class variables are are accessiable to all obects created. These vaiables are defined outside of methods of class including constructor.
	Class methods are accessible with class names, meaning w/o object. Class methods are defined in class with "cls" as first arfument. 
	Instance variables are defined inside constructor/any other method with self. eg: self.name = ....
	Instance methods are defined in class with first argument as self. Constructor is instance method.
	
	Unlike instance variables, instance methods are stored at one place which can be accessed by every object. By this approach memory is saved.
	So slef is useful to call instance methods on every object. 
	Self carries the value of the calling object for instance methods and differantiating address for insance variables.
	Instance variables of every object has separate memory so those variables also has to be initiated with self.
	this is genrally done inside constructor.
	
	In class variables are of type: class, instance, local(loacl to methods: not accessible by class object), static, ... variables
	
	dir(NameOfObject): to obtain list of data attributes and methods associated with a class
